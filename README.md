## Datasets

Here are the datasets used in this project:

- **[Chest X-ray14 (Pneumonia Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)**  
- **[Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)**  
- **[Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)**  
- **[Tuberculosis (TB) Chest X-ray Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset)**  
- **[Osteoporosis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitvkulkarni/lifestyle-factors-influencing-osteoporosis)**  



Key Features:
1. Hybrid Model: Combines classical deep learning with quantum layers to potentially improve the model's performance in image classification tasks.

2. Custom Dataset: Uses an autism dataset with pre-labeled images for binary classification.

3. Performance Comparison: Provides a side-by-side comparison of model accuracy and loss between quantum and non-quantum models.

4. Visualization: Includes detailed plots to visualize model performance across training epochs.

## Libraries

## Frontend Libraries:
React.js: For building the user interface.
Redux: For state management.
TailwindCSS: For styling.
Figma: Used for UI/UX design (external tool).
## Backend Libraries and Frameworks:
Node.js: As the runtime environment for server-side JavaScript.
Express.js: To create APIs and handle server-side routing.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
Flask: A Python microframework for additional backend services.
Cloudinary: For handling and storing media assets like images.

# How It Works:
The project initializes a simple CNN using Keras. Two versions of the model are trained: one with a quantum layer and one without.
The dataset is preprocessed, and the images are converted into a format suitable for training.
The models are trained for 30 epochs, with the results saved and visualized.

# Results:
After training, the notebook outputs a comparison of accuracy and loss for both the quantum-enhanced and classical models, helping assess the impact of quantum layers on performance.
